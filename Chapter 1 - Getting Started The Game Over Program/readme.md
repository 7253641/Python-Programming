# Chapter 1 - Getting Started: The Game Over Program

By learning Python, one can create something as simple as a game to a business product with a full-featured 
graphical interface (GUI). In this chapter you will learn:

- What Python is and what's so great about it
- How to print text to the screen
- What comments are and how to use them

## Facts about Python

**Python is easy to use**: Python has clear and simple rules, its programs are shorter and take less time to create
than programs in many other languages.

**Python is powerful**: You can write programs that employ a GUI, that process files and that use a variety of data 
structures.

**Python is Object-Oriented and flexible**: *Object-oriented programming* is a modern approach to programming, its
 an approach that allows programmers to represent information and actions in a program intuitively. In many other 
languages, OOP is not optional, which makes short programs unnecessarily complex. In Python, OOP is optional.

**Python can be integrated with other languages**: This means that a programmer can take advantage of work already 
done in another language.

**Python runs everywhere**: Python programs are *platform independent*, this means that it will run in any computer 
where Python is installed, independently of the operating system.

**Python has a strong community**: Refer to the [Python Tutor mailing](http://www.mail.python
.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor). Anyone, from novice to expert, can ask and answer any questions.

**Python is Free and Open Source**: Python is free, you can copy or modify Python, you could even resell Python if you
want.

## The print function

The 'print()' function can display text enclosed in quotes, if you just put the parentheses, it will print a blank line.

'''python
>>> print("Hello, World")
Hello, World
'''

This is just a brief explanation of the 'print()' function.

## Interactive and script mode

Most Python IDE's have a console where you can quickly test an idea, this is *interactive mode* as you get inmmediate
feedback. You use *script mode* to make programs than you can execute later on.

Using both modes at the same time is a great way to code, you can use interactive mode to get the function to work 
the way you actually expect it to work before implementing it in your system, for which you should be using script mode.

## Comments

The *comments* are notes for human readers, they are ignored by the computer.

To create a comment in Python you use the '#' symbol. Anything after the symbol (except when used in a string) on the 
rest of the line is a comment.

'''python
# This is a comment.
'''

## Notes

**Note 1**: Python is case-sensitive and by convention, function names are in lowercase.

**Note 2**: Save your programs with the '.py' extension, this allows various applications to recognize these files as
Python programs.
